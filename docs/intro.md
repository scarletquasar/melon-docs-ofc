## Getting Started

âœ¨ **Information**

Currently, the latest Melon package works on top of **npm**, meaning that Melon can be easily executed in any environment with a simple `npm install` since node.js is also installed (or another compatible implementation of npm).

ðŸŽˆ **Recommendations**

Before starting to learn **Melon**, we recommend basic knowledge about JavaScript (preferrable TypeScript) and about the .NET Environment (C#, F# or VisualBasic.NET)

ðŸ’¿ **Requirements**

In the list below, there are the required installations to run Melon locally
- [ASP.NET 6+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

ðŸš€ **Installing**

Melon can easily be installed with the command below:
```
npm install melon-runtime -g
```

ðŸ’» **Getting help**
